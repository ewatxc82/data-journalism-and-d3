## Background

The data set analyzed is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. The goal is to create a scatter plot between two data variables in the dataset to show their relationship. I was intrigued by state poverty levels and lack of healthcare so those were the two variables I chose to review.
